## Ex02 

The following problem has the database: 
p(1). 
p(2):-!. 
p(3). 


a) ?- p(X). 

The first ressult will be 1, the second answer will be 2. But no more results will be presented.   

b) ?- p(X), p(Y).  
This will do all the combinations, but always stop on the p(2). It will never achieve the p(3). 

c) ?- p(X), !, p(Y).   

The first element will not be 2. The only possible results are:  
```
X = 1;   
Y = 2;  

X = 1;  
Y = 2;  
```
