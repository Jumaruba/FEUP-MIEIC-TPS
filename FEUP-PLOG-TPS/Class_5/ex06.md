The first cut is red. Cause if we remove it, we change the program logic.  
The second clause is a green cut. If it's not a person, doesn't matter the other types of species. However, the cut is there to improve the program performance.  We just can assume that this is a green cut, if we assume that turtle and person are mutual exclusive.
